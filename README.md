### Summary: 


- From the June and December moth data analysis, there is no significant difference in wetha er which would effect the business.

- I would suggest to run an extra query on temperature observtaions for each quarter of the year, so that we can get an additional factors which would effect the business.
And also running a query to look at the precipitation for each month would be a good option too as it less crowded during raining weather conditions which may effect the business revenues.

- Gathering more data for choosing specific location for the business to attract the potiential visitors and running an additional queries on weather analysis in a broad way would be beneficial too.
